                <p class="float_right">
                    The soldier robot is the smallest infantry robot.  There are three<br/>
                    of these on the field and they fire the 17mm balls.  They will be one<br/>
                    of the primary damage dealers and are meant for skirmishing and scouting<br/>
                    across the field. They will need to be reliable and highly mobile. Since<br/>
                    part of the challenge is to manufacture 3 copies they will need to be<br/>
                    both robust and easy to manufacture and maintain.

                <h2>
                    Hero:
                </h2>
                <img src="Hero.jpg" alt="Picture of the hero robot.">
                <p class="float_right">
                    The Hero robot is the largest and most powerful robot. It is the only<br/>
                    robot allowed to fire the 42mm rounds, which deal ten times as much<br/>
                    damage as the 17mm! However, because 42mm rounds are only found in the<br/>
                    middle of the field, it will be designed to collect its own 42mm rounds<br/>
                    as well as receive them from the Engineering robot mid-battle. The Hero<br/>
                    will take the brunt of the enemy fire, as well as lead the offensive so<br/>
                    it needs to be built very ruggedly, as well as able to outmaneuver the<br/>
                    enemy Hero robot.

                <p class="float_right">
                    Drone is responsible for scouting out the field and keeping good<br/>
                    visibility for our ground based robots.  It also has a mounted turret<br/>
                    for aerial support however has a limited supply of ammo so it is only<br/>
                    used in dire circumstances.
